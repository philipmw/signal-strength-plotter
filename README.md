# Signal strength plotter #

This is a set of C# / WPF / WCF applications that work in concert to product a heatmap of Verizon's 4G LTE signal strength.

This combines two data sources: real-time signal strength readings from Verizon's official LTE modem application, and real-time GPS coordinates collected from an external GPS sensor.

I wrote this suite of programs in 2012 because I was interested in using a USB LTE modem as my sole Internet connection (I have that digital nomad streak in me), and I wanted to have a project to explore C#, WPF, and WCF.  I ended up having some Win32 API thrown in.

The maiden voyage for this suite of programs was a cross-country Amtrak trip from Iowa to Texas.  I didn't end up becoming a digital nomad, but the software development journey was fun nonetheless.
